    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Alex, a mechanical/mechatronics engineer based in the Seattle area with a passion for undersea systems
      and multidisciplinary electro-mechanical design. At heart, I’m a maker who thrives on solving complex engineering
      problems and is always eager to expand my skills in diverse environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest lies at the intersection of engineering and the ocean. Growing up along the West Coast of the United
      States, the ocean has always been a significant part of my life. Professionally, I relish the challenge of
      designing robust and intelligent systems capable of withstanding the harsh marine environment. My goal is to
      contribute to sustainable technology solutions that address the pressing challenges facing our oceans and our
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m at Penn State University, where I am uniquely positioned at the crossroads of laboratory research
      and field application. As a Research and Development Engineer, I collaborate with scientists in State College, PA,
      to translate experiments and hypotheses into functional hardware. I then work closely with test operators to
      deploy this hardware in the field, ensuring that all assets, sensors, and personnel are prepared for success. I
      enjoy engaging in the full design process from initial concepts to fabrication and integration, to
      conducting tests at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my greatest strengths is my ability to quickly acquire new skills by linking research with past
      experiences. My varied background includes roles such as working with Planted Solar, where I leveraged my
      multidisciplinary expertise to advance clean energy through automation; developing high-altitude balloons for
      internet connectivity at Alphabet’s Loon; and working on micromanufacturing systems for pharmaceuticals at DEKA.
      My personal projects are equally diverse, ranging from robotic baristas to classic cars. If you're interested,
      I've put some of my projects <a href="#projects">below</a>.

      <h3>NILE</h3>
      <h4>Novel Irrigation and Land use Efficiency</h4>
      <p>
        Traditional agricultural methods often result in environmental harm due to inefficient watering and the
        excessive
        use of pesticides and fertilizers. To address this, my five teammates and I developed a cylindrical robotic
        system
        for our senior capstone project. Designed for backyard use but scalable to industrial farms, the system is
        equipped with various sensors that dynamically respond to real-time plant and soil conditions.

      <h3>CaffeBot</h3>
      <h4>A robotic "barista" designed for perfect pour over coffee.</h4>
      <p>
        This project was inspired by two seemingly unrelated events: I had recently learned to solve forward and inverse
        kinematics for robotic systems, and my coffee maker was unreliable. The result was CaffeBot; a project aimed at
        bringing high-quality pour-over coffee to even the busiest university students by automating the meticulous
        process of pour over coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        CaffeBot was designed to mimic the precise flow control and pour patterns of a skilled barista using a two-joint
        robotic arm on a revolute base. While I successfully solved the kinematics and developed a prototype, a
        demanding
        senior year schedule prevented me from fully assembling the final product.

      <h3>Smart ONYX</h3>
      <h4>An Arduino based modification platform for the ONYX RCR electric motorbike.</h4>
      <p>
        In the spring of 2020, I took delivery of an ONYX RCR electric motorbike, which became my pride and joy.
        Although
        not a true motorcycle, it made my daily school commute much more enjoyable. However, the bike lacked essential
        safety features like turn signals. To address this, I created Smart ONYX; a platform to transform my RCR into a
        fully connected smart bike.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I had to sell the bike when an internship took me across the country, I achieved my primary goal of safety
        by implementing a complete set of turn and brake signals. Though the functions were relatively simple, this
        project marked my first experience with real-time systems, where I gained valuable insights into building
        responsive and reliable products.

      <h3>The Booper</h3>
      <h4>Physical communication for a digital world.</h4>
      <p>
        The booper is a communication device was designed to offer a more physical connection than instant messaging,
        inspired by my frequent travels and the desire to stay connected with my significant other over long distances.
        Reminiscent of classic beepers, the device is intentionally simple, allowing users to send and receive a basic
        message: either a "Boop" or a "Beep." In addition, a synced light enhances the experience, enabling shared
        moments
        or coded messages even when far apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device is powered by a Particle Photon, an Arduino derivative designed for IoT projects, and features a
        miniature OLED display and tactile, clicky buttons. Encased in an Altoids tin, it is both portable and durable.

      <h3>EagleSat</h3>
      <p>
        EagleSat was a student-led CubeSat project supported by the NASA Space Grant Program and Embry-Riddle. Our
        mission, EagleSat 2, was a 3U CubeSat that was set to launch in 2021 as part of NASA's CubeSat Launch
        Initiative.
        The spacecraft carried dual scientific payloads: one to detect and track cosmic rays, and another to test the
        effects of space radiation on computer memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the Structures Team Lead, I was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft could withstand the rigors of launch
        and the harsh environment of space. My team and I designed and built a custom 3U CubeSat structure that was both
        lighter and more space-efficient than the commercially available options at the time.
