  <h2>Code Name:</h2>
  <h1>Booper</h1>
  <h3>Physical communication for a digital world.</h3>

  <p>
    This is a communication device that attempts to provide the user with an
    experience that is more physical than instant messaging. This came about
    from my frequent travels where I would spend a significant time away from my
    significant other and desired something that could provide a sense of a
    physical connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reminiscent of the beepers of the recent past, the device is almost
    painfully simple. It allows one to send and receive a simple message, in
    this case, a “Boop” and a “Beep.” The experience comes together with a
    synced light on the device give the option to have a shared experience, or
    send coded messages when worlds away. Despite its simplicity, the
    physicality and novelty makes for a fun, enjoyable user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The brains of the device is a Particle Photon, an arduino derivative
    designed for IoT projects, that has been augmented with a miniature OLED
    display and clicky, tactile buttons. The whole package comes together in an
    Altoids sized tin to create a portable, rouged package.
