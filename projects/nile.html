  <h3>Novel Irrigation and Land use Efficiency.</h3>

  <p>
    Conventional agricultural methods overcompensate plant and soil needs through wasteful watering practices 
    and excessive application of pesticides and fertilizers, leading to substantial environmental damage. This 
    damage takes on various forms, including pollution via runoff, soil depletion, and the extinction of local 
    pollinators.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the problem my five teammates and I chose to tackle for our senior capstone project. After much 
    research, we settled on a backyard scale, cylindrical robotic system that will use a variety of sensor 
    inputs to dynamically react to plant and soil conditions. In the end, our system will be able to 
    autonomously care for plants from the moment they are needed until harvest.
