  <p>
    EagleSat is a student lead CubeSat project supported by the NASA Space Grant
    Program and Embry-Riddle. Our current mission, EagleSat 2, is a 3U CubeSat
    set to launch in 2021 as part of NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative. The
    spacecraft will carry dual scientific payloads; one designed to detect and
    track cosmic rays and the other to test how space radiation can affect
    computer memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the Structures Team Lead is my job to ensure the spacecraft survives
    launch and orbit. To accomplish this task my team and I have designed and
    built a custom 3U CubeSat structure for the mission that is both lighter and
    more space efficient than any commercially available structure. We will take
    this structure and submit it to a bombardment of thermal, shock, and
    vibration tests to ensure it is space ready. In addition to the structure,
    we also manage the spacecraft's thermal control systems to keep all systems
    within optimal temperature ranges in the vacuum of space.
