  <h2>Code Name: </h2>
  <h1>"Fly Like an Eagle"</h1>
  <h3>The official NASA Space Grant club at Embry-Riddle Prescott.</h3>

  <p>
    EagleSat resulted from the collaboration of some amazing students and the
    support of NASA and Embry-Riddle. Our current mission, EagleSat II is a 3U
    CubeSat set to launch sometime around 2021 as part of NASA Space Grant. The
    spacecraft will carry dual scientific payloads designed to detect and track cosmic rays
    in addition to testing how radiation in space can affect computer memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the Structures Team Lead is my job to ensure the spacecraft survives
    launch and orbit. To accomplish this task my team and I have designed and
    built a custom 3U CubeSat structure for the mission that is both lighter
    and more space efficient than any commercially available structure. We will
    take this structure and submit it to a bombardment of thermal, shock, and
    vibration tests to ensure it is ready to be sent to space. In addition to
    the structure, we will also implement a thermal control device to keep all
    systems within optimal temperature ranges in the vacuum of space.
