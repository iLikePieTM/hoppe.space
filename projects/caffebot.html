  <h3>A robotic "barista" designed for perfect pour over coffee.</h3>

  <p>
    Two seemingly independent events collided to inspire this project: I had 
    just learned how to solve for the forward and inverse kinematics of robotic 
    systems and my coffee maker was sh*t. The CaffeBot project attempts to make 
    excellent pour over coffee available to even the busiest univ student by 
    taking time and dedication out of the drip coffee experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pour over method involves exactly what its name implies, pouring hot 
    water over coffee grounds in a filter. What sets this method apart is that 
    the pouring action is done by hand with specific timings and patterns 
    designed to maximize extraction. Caffebot replicates this action with a 
    2-joint robotic arm on a revolute base and a peristaltic pump to ensure a 
    clean and consistent extraction. In this manner it is different than 
    standard batch brew coffee machines because CaffeBot can replicate the 
    careful flow control and pour patterns of a talented barista.
  </p>
  <p>
    The whole device is driven by an Arduino UNO running through sets of joint 
    angles and pump rates  calculated via a MATLAB script. This minimizes the 
    computational load on the microcontroller while allowing for easy updates 
    in the never-ending quest for the perfect brew.
  </p>
  <p>
    CaffeBot is in the final stages of development as processes are refined 
    and final components are being delivered. Check back soon for the final 
    product and GitHub repository containing CAD, wiring, and code.
