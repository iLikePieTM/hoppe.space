  <h3>A Smart Signal Light for the 2017 AEC Design Competition</h3>

  <p>
    The Smart Signal Light is an Internet Of Things (IoT) connected, fully
    programmable LED light with a simple but versatile form.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is designed to function in an industrial setting but can be adapted for a
    variety of situations. The design consists of LED strips arranged in a
    custom extrusion profile, to be visible and easily identifiable from all
    directions at long distances. Using a wireless control module, commands can
    be sent to the device remotely changing the color/pattern of the LED strips
    to convey simple messages quickly and effectively. Alternatively, the Smart
    Signal Light could be connected to existing machinery to provide additional
    functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    In harsh environments, the extruded aluminum casing holds and protects the
    LEDs and control module in addition to allowing for easy mounting. To
    increase functionality, an extruded aluminum coupler can be used to combine
    multiple Smart Signal Lights allowing them to be scaled up or down.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received an honorable mention from the judges, placing 5th out of the 55
    teams. You can see what the judges had to say about my design
