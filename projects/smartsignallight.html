    <p class="subtitle">A Smart Signal Light for the 2017 AEC Desin Competition</p>

    <p class="p">The Smart Signal Light is an Internet Of Things (IOT) connected,
      fully programable LED light with a simple but versatile form. </p>
    <p class="p">It is designed to function in an industrial setting but be adaptable
      to all circumstances. The design consists of LED strips running down a custom
      extrusion profile, arranged in such a way as to be visible and easily identifiable
      from all directions even at long distances. Using a wireless control module,
      commands could be sent to the device remotely changing the color/pattern of
      the LED strips to convey simple messages quickly and effectively. Alternatively,
      the Smart Signal Light could be connected to existing machinery to provide
      additional functionality.</p>
    <p class="p">The extruded aluminum casing holds and protects the LEDs and control
      module in harsh environments and allows for easy mounting. To increase functionality,
      an extruded aluminum coupler could be used to combine two Smart Signal Lights
      allowing them to be scaled up or down depending on the situation.</p>
    <p class="p">I received an honorable mention from the judges, placing 5th out
      of 55 primarily college teams. You can see what the judges had to say about
      my design <a href="http://www.aec.org/?page=iaedc_2017_stu#HM" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
