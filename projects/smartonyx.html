  <h3>An Arduino based modification platform for the ONYX RCR electric motorbike.</h3>

  <p>
    In the spring of 2020, I was lucky enough to take delivery of an ONYX RCR electric motorbike and 
	it was my pride and joy. I have always been a fan of electric alternative vehicles (electric bikes, 
	Onewheels, etc.) but this was my first, quote-unquote, real vehicle. While calling it a true 
	motorcycle would have been a bit of a stretch it certainly made my school commute much more 
	bearable.
  </p>
  <p>
	The one major issue it had was a lack of any signals which, in my option, are necessary to stay safe 
	on the road. Enter, Smart ONYX. Smart ONYX was meant to be a platform upon which I turned my RCR 
	into a fully connected smart bike. Unfortunately, I had to sell my beloved bike when an internship 
	took me to the other side of the country, so I didnâ€™t finish all my grand plans.
  </p>
  <p>
	However, I did accomplish my original goal and implemented a full suite turn and brake signals. 
	While the functions themselves were relatively simple, it was my first foray into real-time 
	systems, and I learned a lot about making a responsive, reliable product.
