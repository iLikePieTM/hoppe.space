    <p class="title">Because I Can</p>
    <p class="subtitle">A simple, almost pure, HTML5/CSS based personal website</p>

    <p class="p">Hoppe.space originated as a “why not” project. I already had the
      domain because I was using it for my custom email but had no plans for a website
      because I didn’t want to pay for hosting. Then I acquired an Orion Omega2+
      and thought setting it up as a personal server to host a website would be a
      fun project.</p>
    <p class="p">And now here you are!</p>
